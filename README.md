# PyTorch Projects

Welcome to the PyTorch Projects repository! This is a collection of small, beginner-friendly projects implemented using PyTorch. Whether you're just starting out with PyTorch or looking for simple examples to build upon, you'll find something interesting here.

## Purpose

The main goals of this repository are:
1. To provide simple, practical examples of PyTorch usage
2. Basically, testing my skills

## Projects

1. Project 1: MNIST Convolutional Neural Network

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.6+
- Numpy
- Pyplot(from Matplotlib)
- PyTorch (latest stable version recommended)
- Other dependencies (list them as you add projects)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/PyTorch-Projects.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   cd PyTorch-Projects
   ```
3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

Each project is contained in its own directory. Navigate to a project's directory and follow the instructions in its individual README file.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! If you have a small PyTorch project that you'd like to add:

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a new branch (`git checkout -b feature/AmazingProject`)
3. Add your project in a new directory
4. Commit your changes (`git commit -m 'Add AmazingProject'`)
5. Push to the branch (`git push origin feature/AmazingProject`)
6. Open a Pull Request
